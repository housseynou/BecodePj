# This is how would be my training journey at Becode.

### We will learn how to create websites.
To create a website we need to know some langages such as:
  *html
  *css
  *javascript
  *php
  *sql, etc.

### But before starting coding for any website, we nned to do some configuration.
Because the working environment is very importante.
So, choosing Ubunto as an op√©rating system could be a very good idea.
But you can use any other operating system if you feel good in that environment.
There are some others alternatives such as:
  1. Installing a virtual environment in your machine so that you can use:
    *Ubuntu
    *Its terminal
  2. Buy another computer if you don't mind flanking hundreds of euro.
